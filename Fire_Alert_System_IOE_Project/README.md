 SD card with 32 GB Storage
 Buzzer
 LED bulb
 Raspberry pi -2/3/4 (4GB RAM)
 Flame Sensor
1.2 Software Requirements
 Programming Language -PYTHON
 Raspberry Pi Operating System installed in SD card
 VNC viewer
 Security
 Testing and Quality Assurance

1.3 API Requirements - TWILIO API

Twilio provides a cloud communications platform that enables sending SMS
programmatically using their REST API.
Some key points on how Twilio is leveraged:
• A Twilio account and auth credentials (Account SID, Auth Token) are
needed to access the API. These are obtained from the Twilio console.
• The Python Twilio library is installed and imported to make API calls.
• A Twilio "Client" object is instantiated using the account credentials. This
is used to make API calls.
• The client's .messages.create() method is used to send the SMS alert.
Parameters like source number, destination number and text message are
passed to this method.
• Once sent, the message object contains properties like message ID (sid)
and status that can be checked to confirm delivery.
• Error handling can be done by checking the error_message property if
messaging fails.
• The from number should be a Twilio number purchased with your
account. The to number can be any mobile number.
• Twilio handles all the underlying infrastructure and networking required
to route the SMS, so the code can focus on message content.


Implementation
2.1 -Defining Requirements and Goals
First, we define the requirements for our fire alarm system:-:
• Detect presence of fire using a flame sensor
• Sound a loud buzzer alarm when fire is detected
• Send SMS text message alerts to predefined numbers
• Interface an LED status indicator
• Run on a Raspberry Pi to provide programmable control

2.2-Selecting Suitable Hardware
To meet these requirements, we will need:
• Raspberry Pi to run the detection and alerting code
• Flame sensor module to detect fire/flames
• Buzzer module to sound audible alarm
• LED module for visual status indication
• Jumper wires to connect the components

2.3- Configure Devices and Sensors
The flame sensor, buzzer and LED attach directly to the GPIO pins on the
Raspberry Pi. We write a Python script to detect state changes on the flame
sensor pin and trigger the alarms.

2.4- Network Configuration
For sending SMS alerts, we leverage the Twilio API. The Raspberry Pi only needs
WiFi connectivity and the Twilio library installed.

2.5- Install and Test Devices
We install Raspbian OS on the Raspberry Pi and test that the flame sensor,
buzzer and LED are responding as expected. The Python script is refined until
the desired behavior is achieved.
